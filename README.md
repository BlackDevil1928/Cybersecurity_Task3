## Suggested Mitigations

  Disable SMBv1: Use sudo systemctl disable smbd and uninstall legacy support.

  Renew SSL Certificates: Replace expired certificates with valid ones from a trusted CA.

  Update OpenSSH: Run sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade openssh-server.

  Close or Restrict RDP Port: If not needed, close port 3389. If needed, use VPN and IP whitelisting.

  Strengthen Password Policies: Enforce complexity rules, lockout thresholds, and expiration via PAM or passwd configs.
